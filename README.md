# RealEstate

a real state app where the builders can post/upload their properties and user can view and book them 
this is just like 24 acres or airbnb but only for company/builders,so that they can post their properties 

we are like a bridge between builder and user.

user can view/ browse all the properties then he can book those properties so that builder can contact them.

builder's dashboard shows who have booked or viewed their properties. 
builder can contact the user from their details and can also chat with the user

roles: 
user,
